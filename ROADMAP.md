## Notes for Developers

### Key Technical Challenges

1. **Collision Prediction**: Detecting future collisions before they happen
2. **Smooth Pathfinding**: Creating natural-looking arc turns
3. **Priority System**: Deciding which vehicle has right-of-way
4. **Performance**: Maintaining 60 FPS with many vehicles

### Best Practices

- Commit after each completed task
